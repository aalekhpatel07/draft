# (Rules for Servers)
The runtime for Raft. 

## WIP

~~This needs a major redo. Full focus has been on [draft-core](../draft-core) so far.~~

- [x] Add the core loop for the Raft runtime.
- [ ] Add tests and documentation.
- [ ] Implement some state mutation channels to complete the core loop.
- [ ] Add a Raft client that accepts tcp/udp/http and relays to the cluster.
- [ ] Add a KeyValue store to operate client requests on.
